# Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Internship: AI & ML Internship  
## Task Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, feature relationships, and important predictors before applying machine learning models.

---

## Dataset Used
**Iris Dataset**
- 150 samples
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
- 4 numerical features

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## EDA Steps Performed
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Statistical summary
3. Histogram analysis
4. Categorical count plot
5. Outlier detection using box plots
6. Correlation heatmap
7. Pair plot visualization
8. Feature importance identification

---

## Key Insights
- Petal length and width are the most important features
- Dataset has no missing values
- No class imbalance
- Minimal outliers present
- Data is suitable for ML modeling

---

## Deliverables
- `EDA_Iris.ipynb`
- `README.md`
- `screenshots/` (visual outputs)

---

## Final Outcome
Clear understanding of data patterns, feature behavior, and readiness for machine learning model development.
